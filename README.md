## Overview

### The challenge

- Reproduce the design layout of the projects design files.
- Website should be responsive.
- Interactive elements should have a hover state, indicating that an action can be made.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and utility classes
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS framework
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned
During this project i got a little more comfortable working with Boostraps grids to make the design responsive across different screen sizes.
I also got to play with CSS and how psuedo classes can be used to create shapes that be used as a design element.



### Continued development
The project needs some small fixes. Some of the code can be optimized to be more readable and trimmed.
Otherwise the next step is to structure and store the text inside the data object of vue, to imitate some of the vue methods in the code like v-for, v-if and text interpolation.

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
